# AppOpener
Moto: To Auto Open the Apps

Senario/Usage:

Most of us when we open the system(PCsLaptops) get angry to open regular using application, such as most of us open chrome, music app, notpad, etc.(our daily work apps) everyday. Most of the time we forgot even the path from wher we will be open them if not found on desktop. Moreover most of us don't want to have a messy desktop and also it take lot of time to load the desktop if we have make thing on it. So to avoid this kind of issue, to have a clean desktop and reduce our app opening work we can use this AppOpener.

Description:

It is very simple to use the application, that is when we open this app we can see a TxtArea/Display box which shows all the applications(.exe) which we have selected to run.

We have a Add Apps button used for selecting the applications/exe files that we want to open on regulat bases, when we click on it will let us to select the app and display it on the Display box.

We have a Run Apps button which is used to open the selected/displayed apps.

Code Highlights:

I have used Kotlin as primary language to building this application.

There are a lot of kotlin concepts incorporated while building this app to mention some:

(i) Used TornadoFX to build this application it is an hert of this app, used for GUI pusrose.

(ii) Kotlin one liners really made the code very easy to read and most importantly helped in getting rid of the excessive code needed for small operations like looping and conditional statements.

(iii) Kotlinx type inference made a lot of things simpler when dealing with the declarations and using var and val type variables.

(iv) Kotlin arrayof and List helped me in putting all the slected path at right place and display then as needed.

(V) Kotlin try catch and null check concepts are used to handle exceptions and avoid errors.
